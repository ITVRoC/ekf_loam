# Adaptive Filter Package


Adaptive Filter Package is a filter that provides sensor fusion for the best accuracy in LiDAR SLAM odometry input, fusing wheel odometry with inertial sensor data and LiDAR odometry. This filter is part of the EKF-LOAM package, that is an update of the LeGO-LOAM, and has the adaptive covariances for wheel and LiDAR odometry. Depending on the angular velocity of the robot, two matrices are considered for wheel odometry. The LiDAR odometry covariance matrix depends on the number of edge and planar features identified in the environment.

## The System:

LiDAR SLAM techniques accumulate significant errors when estimating the device's position in environments with few geometric features, such as tunnels, galleries, or even extensive and homogeneous corridors. These environments characterize several places in which the EspeleoRob√¥ is supposed to operate. Aiming to correct eventual errors in the odometry and map computation, we use a filter to incorporate the measurement of wheel speed with the IMU data in the LiDAR SLAM. This information is used between the stages of the Back-End and Front-End of the SLAM. Fig.1 depicts the proposed structure.

In environments with few geometric features, LiDAR odometry presents errors in estimating the pose propagated to the LiDAR mapping, causing misalignment between the set of points **L**[k] and the map **M**[k-1], and generating map deformations and incorrect pose estimations **x_M**[k]. Therefore, our strategy uses an EKF to correct the pose estimate **x_L**[k] by combining LiDAR odometry with wheel odometry and IMU data. Thus, we propose an adaptive covariance matrix for LiDAR odometry according to the number of features identified in the environment. The new corrected pose is used in the mapping module to align the set **L**[k] with the map. Likewise, the corrected information is also used to integrate the transformations that generate the estimated output pose. The EKF integrated with the LiDAR SLAM allows to correct the pose estimation and the map in low feature environments.
