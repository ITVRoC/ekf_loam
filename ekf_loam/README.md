# EKF-LOAM

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
EKF-LOAM (Extended Kalman Filter - LiDAR Odometry And Mapping), is an update of the LeGO-LOAM (LightWeight and Ground Optimized - LOAM) algorithm (https://github.com/RobustFieldAutonomyLab/LeGO-LOAM.), designed to handle robot path over/underestimation in environments with few geometric features. This new solution proposes a sensor fusion strategy that merges information from wheel odometry, IMU and LiDAR odometry estimation, which uses an adaptive covariance scheme that is defined according to the number of identified geometric features in the environment.

## The system

<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
The localization and mapping strategy of this package is called EKF-LOAM is an adaptation of the LeGO-LOAM strategy that is a lightweight version of the LOAM method, optimized for ground vehicles, adapted for the EspeleoRobô. This approach is lightweight and therefore allows its execution on embedded computers such as the Nvidia Jetson Nano, providing the odometry at 10 Hz and the map at 2 Hz. According to figure below, the EKF-LOAM has 6 modules: Segmentation, Features Extraction, Adaptive Filter (EKF), LiDAR Odometry, LiDAR Mapping, and Transform Integration. Inputs are the LiDAR raw point cloud and IMU data, while outputs are the robot pose and the environment (point cloud) map. Segmentation, Feature Extraction, LiDAR Odometry, LiDAR Mapping, and Integration Transform.

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
The point cloud of the LiDAR sensor is initially processed in the Pre-Treatment module, where the points are remapped into a range image, the outliers removed, and the data is segmented. In the LiDAR Odometry module, the points are separated into two main sets, one for edge points and the other for points belonging to planes, referred to here as planar points. These features are separated up to a maximum number for edges and planes per range image, discarding the additional features identified in the point cloud. The merged data is introduced between LiDAR SLAM's Back-End and Front-End stages, providing the algorithm with a better estimate of the robot's displacement. Our framework also uses an adaptive covariance scheme for LiDAR odometry, which is defined according to the number of geometric features identified in the environment.

## Dependency

- [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation) (tested with indigo and kinetic)
- [gtsam](https://github.com/borglab/gtsam/releases) (Georgia Tech Smoothing and Mapping library, 4.0.0-alpha2)

```
  wget -O ~/Downloads/gtsam.zip https://github.com/borglab/gtsam/archive/4.0.0-alpha2.zip
  cd ~/Downloads/ && unzip gtsam.zip -d ~/Downloads/
  cd ~/Downloads/gtsam-4.0.0-alpha2/
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake ..
  sudo make install
```

## Compile

You can use the following commands to download and compile the package.

```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/ITVRoC/ekf_loam.git
cd ..
catkin_make ekf_loam -j1
```
<p style='text-align: justify;'> 
When you compile the code for the first time, you need to add "-j1" behind "catkin_make" for generating some message types. "-j1" is not needed for future compiling.
</p>

### Note:
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
If you are using Ubuntu 20.04 with ROS Noetic and if you have an error in voxel_grid.h, e.g. Eigen::Index is not a member of Eigen, modify /usr/include/pcl-1.10/pcl/filters/voxel_grid.h at line 340 and line 669.

Original:
</p>

```
for (Eigen::Index ni = 0; ni < relative_coordinates.cols (); ni++)
```
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Change to:
</p>

```
for (int ni = 0; ni < relative_coordinates.cols (); ni++) 
```

If you have an error in LiDARMapping.cpp, install this package: 
```
sudo apt-get install libparmetis-dev
```

Another possible erro is fix comment the line 21 in the file /usr/include/tbb/task_scheduler_init.h.
